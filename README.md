VerticalTimeline is a macOS Todo application with a unique vertical timeline interface that helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently.

FULLY GENERATED BY SONNET 3.7

## Features

- **Vertical Timeline Interface**: Scroll up to see previous days, scroll down to see future days
- **Automatic Task Roll-over**: Unfinished tasks automatically roll over to the next day
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are stored in plain text Markdown files
- **Day-based Organization**: Tasks are organized by day with clear date headers
- **Minimalist Design**: Clean, focused interface for distraction-free task management
- **Configurable Storage Location**: Choose where to store your todo data
- **Apple Silicon Support**: Optimized for the latest macOS hardware

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **TodoManager**: Central data management class that coordinates todos between the UI and storage
- **TodoFileManager**: Handles file operations for storing and retrieving todo data
- **VerticalTimelineView**: Main view that displays the scrollable timeline of days
- **DayView**: Displays tasks for a specific day with completion controls
- **SettingsView**: Allows configuration of the application's storage location

### Data Storage

- **Active Todos**: Stored in a single `todo.md` file
- **Completed Todos**: Each day's completed todos are stored in separate Markdown files with date-based filenames
- **Security-scoped Bookmarks**: Used to maintain access to user-selected storage folders between app launches

## Technical Details

### Frameworks & Technologies

- **SwiftUI**: Used for the entire user interface
- **Swift**: Core application logic
- **SwiftData**: Data model annotations
- **Foundation**: File management and date handling

### Key Design Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Uses `ObservableObject` and `@Published` properties to update UI when data changes
- **Singleton Pattern**: `TodoFileManager` is implemented as a singleton for centralized file access
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separation of data models, view models, and views

### File Structure

- **VerticalTimelineApp.swift**: Entry point of the application
- **ContentView.swift**: Root view container
- **VerticalTimelineView.swift**: Main scrollable timeline view
- **DayView.swift**: Individual day view with todos
- **TodoManager.swift**: Business logic for todo management
- **TodoFileManager.swift**: File I/O operations
- **Item.swift**: Todo data model
- **SettingsView.swift**: Application settings interface

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- macOS 12 or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel Mac

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `VerticalTimeline.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run the application

### Default Data Location

By default, the application stores data in:
```
~/Documents/TodoData/
```

You can change this location in the Settings.

## Implementation Details

### Todo Management

- Each todo has a title, completion status, and associated date
- Active todos are displayed for the current day and future days
- Completed todos stay with the day they were completed
- Uncompleted todos automatically roll over to the next day

### Error Handling

- The app gracefully handles permission issues with file access
- If the selected data folder becomes inaccessible, the app automatically falls back to the default folder

### UI Features

- Scroll to today button for quick navigation
- Add new todo button on each day
- Clean visual separation between days
- Checkbox interactions for completing todos
